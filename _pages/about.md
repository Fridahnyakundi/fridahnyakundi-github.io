I am a PhD candidate in Emmetr Interdisciplinary Program in Environmental and Resources at [Stanford University]. In my research, I use spatial and applied economics methods to study natural resources use and management in Sub-Saharan Africa. In my doctoral research, i write three essays on risks in aquaculture expansion in Lake Victoria, Kenya.

My **job market paper**, titled *"Spatiotemporal Classification of Cage Culture on Lake Victoria, Kenya"*, uses novel land use classification techniques to analyze expansion and abandonment trends in cage aquaculture and their relationship to environmental and institutional risk. 

In other ongoing work, I explore:
- How risk perception and management strategies vary across aquaculture systems;
- The drivers of periodic mass fish kills in Lake Victoria using hydrodynamic and demographic modeling;
- The design of spatially targeted, context-specific extension services.

I am passionate about producing policy-relevant research that informs sustainable development and environmental governance, particularly in the Global South.
